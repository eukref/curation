ARMOPHOREA
Curator: Vittorio Boscaro



Class Armophorea is not always recovered as monophyletic in trees, with Caenomorphidae sometimes branching separately from all other armophoreans. However, it is recovered as monophyletic in this analysis and provisionally annotated simply as Armophorea.


Of the two recognized orders, Armophorida and Clevelandellida, the first is not monophyletic. The tree supports the hypothesis that the parasitic clevelandellids derive from an armophorid ancestor. Armophorida is hence not annotated at all, while Clevelandellida is.


Caenomorpha (the only representative of Caenomorphidae) is strongly supported as monophyletic and annotated at the genus and family level. The labelling of two other, separated sequences as “Caenomorphidae” is ignored for this classification purpose for lack of morphological information (in the corresponding paper, they are called “Caenomorpha-like”).


The other armophorids are spread in the tree. The genus Metopus in particular appears highly polyphyletic. There is however one supported clade that only includes members of Metopidae (some Metopus and Brachonella), and it is annotated as Metopidae[1]. A subclade only including Metopus sequences is annotated as Metopus[1], although many Metopus sequences are not included. Brachonella is annotated (many sequences deposited as “Metopus contortus” lumped in the same cluster are actually Brachonella contorta (1)). Urostomides (and the family Apometopidae it represents), Palmarella, Heterometopus and Parametopidium are annotated. Atopospira is lumped with some Metopus sequences, and cannot be annotated.

Within Clevelandellida, the two families (Clevelandellidae and Nyctotheridae) cannot be annotated, because they are entangled. One “supported” clade is annotated as Nyctotheridae[1], corresponding to the genus Nyctotheroides (also annotated). Clevelandella and Nyctotherus are instead partially overlapping in the same clusters.



ENVIRONMENTAL CLADES:

One small environmental clade, ARMOP1, falls between Caenomorphidae and the remaining armophoreans. If Armophorea is not indeed monophyletic, this clade might cluster outside known classes.

CARIACOTRICHEA
Curators: Vittorio Boscaro, Luciana Santoferrara



The entire environmental clade is annotated as ‘Cariacotrichea’ because it corresponds to clades indicated as such in recent literature (although the signature sequence indicated by Orsi et al (1) is by no mean universal).

Only the cluster containing the type sequence is annotated at the order (Cariacotrichida), family (Cariacotrichidae), and genus (Cariacothrix) level, because the diagnostic characters are impossible to verify for the other environmental clusters.

CHOREOTRICHIA
Curator: Luciana Santoferrara


Subclass Choreotrichia 
The final tree shows poor resolution, even if it was built according to the latest EukRef-Ciliophora instructions and there are no obvious errors in the corresponding alignments (both before and after trimming). Some of the explanations for low resolution are: 1- some taxa are known to show low resolution in SSU rRNA gene (SSU DNA) phylogenetic inferences (e.g. Agatha and Strüder-Kypke 2014, Santoferrara et al. 2017); 2- there may be gaps in the taxa represented in the tree (e.g. some families do not have named representatives in the trees, and may be unrepresented or only represented by relatively short sequences); these gaps may leave some relationships unresolved; and 3- this subclass is among the most abundant organisms in one of the most common targets of environmental sequencing (marine plankton); thus, a high amount of sequences are available, and many of them are relatively short (<1000 bp). 
Despite the low resolution of the tree, annotations are as complete as possible, following the EukRef-Ciliophora rules. Annotation of nodes poorly supported in the final tree is based on additional knowledge (mostly published bibliography, and in some cases observations from other analyses such as manual examination of alignments, BLAST and additional phylogenetic analyses). 
The monophyly of Choreotrichia is well supported (89% bootstrap support = BS), and thus annotated. This subclass includes two orders, Choreotrichida and Tintinnida. 
Choreotrichida is not monophyletic in our tree and all published SSU DNA inferences (Lynn 2008; Agatha and Strüder-Kypke 2014; Santoferrara et al 2017). Because this issue cannot be solved at present (one family and some genera lack representatives in the tree, and many more lack detail cytological study), it is still an accepted taxon. However, following the EukRef-Ciliophora rules, this order is not annotated here. This is not a proposed taxonomic act, but just a consequence of EukRef-Ciliophora annotation rules. 
Five families are traditionally included in Choreotrichida:
The family Lynnellidae (Liu et al. 2011) is proposed as included within Choreotrichida given phylogenetic and morphological support (Agatha and Strüder-Kypke 2014; Santoferrara et al 2017). Liu et al. (2015) have proposed a separate order for this family (Lynnellida), but this seems premature and it is thus disregarded (Agatha and Strüder-Kypke 2014; Santoferrara et al 2017). The family and its only genus are monophyletic and annotated. 
The family Strombidinopsidae and some of its genera are known as non-monophyletic (Liu et al 2016). Also, Parastrombidium is not represented by a labeled sequence yet, but may correspond to the environmental sequences included in the former clades. Thus, Strombidinopsidae is not annotated. But Strombidinopsis and Parastrombidinopsis are monophyletic and annotated. 
The family Leegaardiellidae has only one named representative in the tree. This sequence and others included in the same clade share two signature deletions, suggesting common affiliation. This clade was formerly labeled as “cluster X” in environmental surveys (e.g. Santoferrara et al. 2014). The signature deletions are also present in some neighboring environmental sequences that were not annotated because they do not cluster within the clade that includes the named representative. 
The clade annotated as the family Strobilidiidae has very low support (3% BS) and it is unclearly crowned by environmental sequences in our tree. However, all the identified species sequenced for this family (and only for this family), are included in this clade. A reason for low support may be the relatively short length of many of the sequences, which are usually abundant and diverse in environmental data (Santoferrara et al. 2014). The later, however, is a good reason to annotate this clade, which could be valuable in environmental surveys. Genus assignation is too ambiguous, and thus avoided. 
The family Lohmanniellidae does not have a labeled representative in the tree and thus remains un-annotated. 

Tintinnida is not monophyletic in our tree. Still, this is a widely accepted taxon (e.g. Lynn 2008; Agatha and Strüder-Kypke 2014; Santoferrara et al 2017), and it is thus annotated. Based on all published tintinnid phylogenies, the problems observed in our current tree is very likely artificial (probably due to alignment trimming as per EukRef rules). 
Four families (Tintinnidiidae, Tintinnidae, Eutintinnidae and Favellidae) and three genera (Tintinnidium, Eutintinnus, Favella) were annotated with no problems: their monophyly is well supported in our tree and generally acknowledged (Lynn 2008, with some changes by Bachy et al 2012 and Santoferrara et al 2017). Tintinnidae is only represented by environmental sequences in our tree because they are longer than the corresponding identified sequences. Genera in this later family are not monophyletic and thus not annotated.
Eight Tintinnida families (Rhabdonellidae, Ptychocylididae, Epiplocylididae, Cyttarocylididae, Dyctiocystidae, Stenosemellidae, Undellidae, Xystonellidae) and several insertae sedis genera (Tintinnopsis, Helicostomella, Climacocylis, Leprotintinnus, Rhizodomus, Stylicauda) are known as non-monophyletic, and/ or to form polytomies. This part of the tintinnid tree always shows low resolution (Agatha and Strüder-Kypke 2014; Santoferrara et al 2017). In addition, some of their genera are not discriminated at 97% cutoff (mixed clusters). For these reasons, these 8 families and incertae sedis were annotated up to order. 
Also labeled as Tintinnida there are three environmental sequences. They do not cluster together, and thus are not labeled as environmental clade. One Tintinnida family does not have a labeled representative in the tree and thus remains un-annotated. 
Some environmental sequences with unclear affiliation were annotated up to subclass (Choreotrichia).

COLPODEA
Curator: Vittorio Boscaro



The four main, highly supported clades correspond to orders as defined in Foissner et al. (1), hence that classification scheme is followed. However, most genera and families are either too similar and/or too entangled to be annotated.


Within Colpodida, Colpoda is not monophyletic, and many genera share the same clusters and cannot be annotated. The exceptions are Hausmanniella, Ilsiella, Jaroschia, Notoxoma, Sandmanniella, and Bardeliella. Families are generally non-monophyletic. The only annotated families are the mono-generic Bardeliellidae and Sandmanniellidae, plus Jaroschiidae (only represented by Jaroschia - formally belonging to Bursariomorphida, but not included in the revisioned order’s diagnosis, hence it is not a conflict to include it in Colpodida).


In Cyrtolophosidida, all genera are monophyletic and annotated (Aristerostoma, Cyrtolophosis, Pseudocyrtolophosis, Apocyrtolophosis, Microdiaphanosoma). However, the family Cyrtolophosididae cannot be annotated because Microdiaphanosoma (formally belonging to the non-monophyletic Kreyellidae) is nested within it.


Bursariomorphida is represented only by two genera, Bryometopus (Bryometopidae) and Bursaria (Bursariidae). Bursaria is monophyletic in the expanded tree, but too similar to one species of Bryometopus and included in the same cluster. Thus, no genus or family in this order can be annotated.


In Platyophryida, many genera are too similar to be annotated (the exception is Platyophrya). Sagittaria (Sagittariidae) clusters within family Woodruffiidae (Woodruffides, Rostrophrya, Sagittaria, Etoschophrya and Kuklikophrya), so neither family is annotated. Similarly, Sorogena (Sorogeniidae) clusters within family Platyophryidae (Platyophrya, Platyophryides, Ottowphrya).

EUPLOTIA
Curator: Vittorio Boscaro



The subclass Euplotia, including Euplotida, Discocephalida, and Pseudoamphisiellida, is generally recognized. The nomenclature of orders and suborders is instead extremely confused. Since the tree does not fit particularly well any of the proposed classifications, and that most families and many genera are monophyletic and informative, orders and suborders are not annotated.


Monophyly of the large genus Euplotes and the monogeneric family Euplotidae are strongly supported (following the vast majority of recent literature, the non-monophyletic genera Euplotoides, Euplotopsis, and Moneuplotes are considered junior synonyms of Euplotes and disregarded). The subdivision of major clades within the genus proposed by Syberg-Olsen et al. (1) has also been followed to organize the large number of Euplotes representative sequences.
Similarly, Certesia and Certesiidae are monophyletic.
Aspidiscidae, only represented by Aspidisca, is monophyletic.
Gastrocirrhidae is monophyletic, but the two genera Gastrocirrhus and Euplotidium are too similar to be annotated separately.
Discocephalidae is monophyletic. Discocephalus is also monophyletic and annotated, but Prodiscocephalus and Paradiscocephalus are too similar to be annotated separately.
Pseudoamphisiellidae is monophyletic, but its genera (Leptoamphisiella and Pseudoamphisiella) are non-monophyletic and tangled, and are not annotated.
Uronychiidae is not monophyletic in the tree, but is split in two supported clades. Uronychiidae[1] includes Uronychia, Apodiophrys and Paradiophrys; Uronychiidae[2] includes Diophrys, Diophryopsis, Pseudodioprhys and Heterodiophrys. Among genera, Uronychia, Diophryopsis, Apodiophrys and Heterodiophrys are annotated.



ENVIRONMENTAL CLADES:

SPIEU2 is identified within Euplotes, as sister group to clade D. SPIEU1 is either the sister group or included in Aspidiscidae.

HETEROTRICHEA
Curator: Vittorio Boscaro



Heterotrichea includes a single order, Heterotrichida.
All families defined by Shazib et al. (1) (Climacostomidae, Spirostomidae, Peritromidae, Condylostomatidae, Gruberiidae, Blepharismidae, Stentoridae, Fabreidae, Maristentoridae, and Folliculinidae), are monophyletic. All represented genera (Anigsteinia, Blepharisma, Chattonidium, Climacostomum, Condylostentor, Condylostoma, Condylostomides, Eufolliculina, Fabrea, Folliculina, Gruberia, Linostomella, Maristentor, Peritromus, Spirostomum, and Stentor) are monophyletic or represented by a single distinct sequence. The support for Condylostoma is low. All genera are annotated with the exclusion of Folliculina and Eufolliculina, which are difficult to identify and have not been corroborated by multiple characterizations.

One cluster (8 sequences) of environmental sequences are identified as “uncultured Folliculinidae” in GenBank, but they belong to a separate lineage in the tree.

KARYORELICTEA
Curator: Vittorio Boscaro



The order Protostomatida (Trachelocercidae+Kentrophoridae) is recovered as a clade and annotated. It is however poorly supported. Its two families (Kentrophoridae is monogeneric, including only Kentrophoros) are recovered with somewhat higher support.
Within Trachelocercidae, Apotrachelocerca, Prototrachelocerca, and Kovalevaia are distinct enough to warrant a genus-level annotation. Trachelocerca, Tracheloraphis and Trachelolophos are tangled, too similar and/or surrounded by uncultured trachelocercids, and were not annotated.
Prototrachelocercidae is considered a synonym of Trachelocercidae according to Lynn 2008. Its three genera (Apotrachelocerca, Trachelolophos and Prototrachelocerca) do not cluster together


The order Loxodida is represented only by family Loxodidae, which is recovered as a strongly supported clade.
Loxodes is recovered as monophyletic, but Remanella is not. Since there is no “supported” clade of Remanella, the genus is not annotated.


The order Protoheterotrichida, with the only family Geleiidae, is strongly supported. All three genera (Geleia, Parduczia, and Corlissina) are monophyletic and annotated.


Wilbertomorpha colpoda is annotated in its own family Wilbertomorphidae (1), incertae sedis in the class.

LITOSTOMATEA
Curators: Qianqian Zhang, Eleni Gentekaki



The subclass Haptoria is non-monophyletic; 8 well supported clades are annotated as Haptoria [1-8].

Haptoria [1]: the family Helicoprorodontidae (Lynn 2008) is monophyletic and is represented by genera Trachelotractus and Helicoprorondon. This family is monophyletic and well supported. Previously, Vadacy 2014 and Gao et al. 2016, treated the family as incertae sedis in class Litostomatea. Herein we followed Lynn 2002 and annotate it as Haptoria [1].
Haptoria [2]: The genus Chaenea is monophyletic and supported, but is only represented by two species. Vadacy et al. 2014, treated this genus as incertae sedis in class Litostomatea. We followed Lynn 2002 to annotate the clade as Haptoria [2].
Haptoria [3]: the genera Fuscheria and Enchelyodon are merged in one cluster (97% similarity), thus they will not show in the classification
Haptoria [4]: The order Didiniida is monophyletic and supported (Vadacy et al. 2011a, b, 2014). Species of genera Monodinium and Didinium are merged in one cluster (97% similarity), thus they will not show in the classification.
Haptoria [5]: The order Pleurostomatida is monophyletic and supported (Lynn 2008). The family Kentrophyllidae is monophyletic and supported (Wu et al. 2015). The genera Epiphyllum and Kentrophyllum are merged in one cluster (97% similarity), thus they will not show in the classification. The genera Loxophyllum, Litonotus, Amphileptus, and Hemiophrys are non-monophyletic, hence they will not show in the classification.
Haptoria [6]: the order Lacrymariida (Vadacy et al. 2011a, b, 2014) is monophyletic and supported. The family Lacrymariidae (Lynn 2008) is monophyletic and supported. The genus Phialina is non-monophyletic, but no supported clade was found, hence it is not shown in the classification. The genus Lacrymaria is monophyletic, but only represented by one species (cluster).
Haptoria [7]: the order Spathidiida (Vadacy et al. 2011a, b, 2014) is non monophyletic, but one clade can be recognized, which is named as Spathidiida [1]. Family Spathidiidae (Lynn 2008) is non monophyletic, but one clade can be recognized, which is named as Spathidiidae [1].
The genera Spathidium, Epispathidium, Arcuospathidium are merged in one cluster, thus they will not show in the classification.
Haptoria [8]: the genus Homalozoon is monophyletic, but is only represented by one sequence. This genus was treated as incertae sedis in Vadacy et al. 2014.

OLIGOHYMENOPHOREA
Curator: Vittorio Boscaro



PENICULIA

As it is commonly observed, the order Peniculida is monophyletic, but does not cluster with the monogeneric order Urocentrida. Hence, peniculids are annotated as Peniculia[1] (=Peniculida). 

Within Peniculida, Parameciidae (=Paramecium), Lembadionidae (=Lembadion) and Paranassulidae (=Paranassula) are monophyletic and annotated. Frontoniidae are not monophyletic. The genus Frontonia is highly polyphyletic, and Stokesia (itself non-monophyletic), a member of Stokesiidae, is strongly associated with Disematostoma (Frontoniidae). As a result, no genus is annotated (with the exception of the divergent Apofrontonia). Two “supported” clades are annotated as Frontoniidae[1] and Frontoniidae[2], but they do not cover all the diversity of Frontoniidae.

Urocentrida corresponds to a single cluster, and is not annotated at the subclass level (but Urocentrida, Urocentridae and Urocentrum are annotated).



HYMENOSTOMATIA

The monophyly of the subclass itself is highly supported. The two orders, Tetrahymenida and Ophryoglenida, are also monophyletic and annotated. 

Within Tetrahymenida, the single sequence of Agolohymena is annotated. It is also assigned to the family Deltopylidae according to Bourland & Struder-Kypke (1), although the validity of the family needs to be validated by a sequence of its type genus. 
The family Glaucomidae (syn. Bromeliophryidae) is monophyletic. Its genera (Glaucoma, Glaucomides, Anteglaucoma, Bromeliophrya) are however tangled and/or sharing the same cluster, and are not annotated. Additionally, Turaniellidae is paraphyletic, basal to Glaucomidae - the family and its genera (Colpidium and Dexiostoma, either paraphyletic or too similar) are not annotated.
Tetrahymena is not monophyletic due to T. paravorax and a Tetrahymena sp. branching separately from the clusters containing most other Tetrahymena plus Lambornella. These genera and the family Tetrahymenidae are not annotated.

Ophryoglenida only includes one cluster. This cluster includes both Ichthyophthirius (Ichthyophthiriidae) and Ophryoglena (Ophryoglenidae), so genera and families are not annotated.



PERITRICHIA

As in many (but not all) 18S tree, the monophyly of this subclass is not recovered (it is instead in phylogenetic analyses, (2).


Peritrichia[1] correspond to the monophyletic order Mobilida. Within the order, if Leiotrocha serpularum is in fact Urceolaria serpularum (3), the two families Urceolariidae and Trichodinidae are monophyletic (with high support). Urceolaria is the only represented genus of Urceolariidae. Trichodinella stems within the clade of Trichodina. Trichodinella is annotated, and two subclades of Trichodina with high bootstrap support are annotated as Trichodina[1] and Trichodina[2] (not all Trichodina species are included in these subclades).


There is strong support for the monophyly of the order Sessilida (Peritrichia[2]), which is itself divided into two clearly separate clades that do not correspond to any described taxon.
As is well known, many taxa within the order appear polyphyletic in 18S trees. As a result, few families and genera can be annotated. In particular, Epistylis, Telotrochidium, Vorticella and Zoothamnium are scattered throughout the sessilid clades.

One sessilid subclade, corresponding to the “Basal Clade” in Sun et al. (4), includes Campanella (Epistylididae; genus annotated), Pseudepystilis (Epystilididae; genus annotated) and Epistylis galea, plus representatives of Operculariidae. Two clusters of Pyxidium are separated from the clade including other members of the family (annotated as Operculariidae[1]). No Operculariidae genus can be annotated. The subclade includes also three annotated environmental clades (OLIGO1-3, the first included in Operculariidae[1]). Interestingly, the voucher sequence for Philaccolilus mekus, a Dytiscidae beetle, falls in this sessilid subclade too (it is probably a ciliate parasite or commensal sequenced by mistake).

In the other sessilid subclade, most traditional genera and families are hopelessly tangled. In Sun et al. (4), families were redefined according to clades also recovered here - however, genera were not, so several genera have species in more than one family. Since this is unlikely to be commonly accepted until genera are also redefined, and since no diagnosis was provided, the classification scheme is not followed here, and the usual rules are followed. As a consequence, only few taxa below the order level can be annotated.
The family Vaginicolidae itself is monophyletic and annotated (though its genera, Cothurnia and Vaginicola, are not - one clade is annotated as Vaginicola[1]).
Members of Zoothamniidae (Zoothamnium, Zoothamnopsis, Myoschiston) are scattered across three clades. One is annotated at the family level (Zoothamniidae[1]), while the second does not have enough support and the third includes members of Vorticellidae. No genus is annotated.
A clade including only members of Epystilididae (Epystilis and Opisthostyla, tangled and/or non-monophyletic) clusters within the Zoothamniidae, but it is not annotated due to low support. Basal to it, there is also another sequence of Telotrochidium (Vorticellidae).
A supported and isolated clade includes only representatives of the family Scyphidiidae. However, two sequences of Scyphidia fall elsewhere in the tree, hence the clade is annotated as Scyphidiidae[1].  Mantoscyphidia is annotated at the genus level.
The last large clade contains mostly Vorticellidae representative, but also many representatives of other families, and no genera can be annotated with the exception of Apocarchesium, 



SCUTICOCILIATIA

Scuticociliate phylogeny is particularly complex, and very few taxa are recognized as monophyletic in the tree. None of the published classification schemes fit the tree particularly well.

Dexiotrichides (Loxocephalidae) and Cinetochilum (Cinetochilidae) (both formerly Philasterida) are completely separated from other scuticociliates and each other. They are individually annotated at the genus level.

The other Cinetochilidae genera (Sathrophilus, Platynematum and Pseudoplatynematum) cluster together, but with very low support. Hence, the family is not annotated at all (while each genus is). Another Loxocephalidae genus, Dexiotricha (itself non-monophyletic) is associated with Conchophthirus (Conchophthiridae, Pleuronematida). Conchophthirus is annotated at the genus and family level. The remaining Loxocephalidae genera represented in the tree, Paratetrahymena and Cardiostomatella, are in a different poorly supported clade, and are also annotated only at the genus level.

Cyclidium porcatum and Pseudocyclidium longum occur on very long branches, distant from other scuticociliates. Pseudocyclidium is annotated at the genus level, but Cyclidium is not, since it is highly polyphyletic.

All remaining scuticociliates are included in two large, supported clades. They appear to be sister groups, but since the node containing both is not supported, they are annotated separately as Scuticociliatia[1] and Scuticociliatia[2].

Scuticociliatia[1] corresponds to order Philasterida as currently defined (5). Former members of Philasterida (“Loxocephalidae” and “Cinetochilidae”) that do not cluster within the clade are often separated in current classifications. Hence, the order is annotated simply as Philasterida.
Most families (Orchitophryidae, Paralembidae, Parauronematidae, Philasteridae, Uronematidae) and genera represented by multiple taxa are not monophyletic and are not annotated. Exceptions include Biggaria (and the family Cryptochilidae, of which it is the only representative), Cohnilembus (=Cohnilembidae), Glauconema, Madsenia, Mesanophrys, Myxophyllum (and the family Thigmophryidae, of which it is the only representative), Porpostoma, Pseudocohnilembus (=Pseudocohnilembidae), Schizocaryum (=Schizocaryidae) and Uronemella.
A small environmental clade, OLIGO9, is also identified within Philasterida.

Scuticociliatia[2] is itself divided into two well supported clades. One includes members of Pleuronematida and Thigmotrichida. No order is annotated within this clade, because no good group is recognized, that only includes representatives of one of the two orders. Only the genera Cristigera and Protophyra are further annotated. Three sequences attributed to tardigrades are nested in this group. A small environmental clade, OLIGO10, is also annotated. 
The second clade within Scuticociliatia [2] only includes pleuronematids, and is annotated as Pleuronematida[1]. Very few families and genera can be annotated, because most are either non-monophyletic or too similar. Exceptions are Eurystomatellidae (the two genera Eurystomatella and Wilbertia are too similar to be separated), Ctedoctematidae (only represented by Hippocomos), Histiobalantiidae (monogeneric, Histiobalantium) and Schizocalyptra. The genus Cyclidium is particularly scattered in the tree. The family Pleuronematidae and the genus Pleuronema constitute a crown group in this clade, but they are not monophyletic due to the inclusion of Schizocalyptra, Mytilophilus and Peniculistoma; however, two supported clades are identified and annotated as Pleuronematidae[1] | Pleuronema[1] and Pleuronematidae[2] | Pleuronema[2].



ASTOMATIA

The monophyly of Astomatia (containing a single order, Astomatida) is strongly supported.
However, despite the good resolution of the topology, both genera and families are severely entangled and/or too similar to each other. The monophyly of all three represented families (Anoplophryidae, Clausilocolidae, Radiophryidea) is rejected. Several genera share clusters, the exceptions being Anoplophrya and Durchoniella. However, no genera or family is annotated, considering the obvious need for revision of the subclass and the molecular similarities among different taxa.



APOSTOMATIA

The subclass itself is monophyletic and supported.
The family Foettingeriidae (Apostomatida), represented by several genera, is monophyletic (within it, Gymnodinioides may not be, and Hyalophysa and Vampyrophrya are too similar at the molecular level. Only Synophrya is annotated). The order Apostomatida is represented also by Pseudocolliniidae (Fusiforma and Pseudocollinia, in the same cluster), but the two families do not cluster together. Hence, the larger clade of Foettingeriidae is annotated as Apostomatida[1], while Pseudocolliniidae are not annotated at the order level.
Chromidina, representing the family Opalinopsidae and the order Astomatophorida, is annotated.



OTHER ENVIRONMENTAL CLADES:

OLIGO4-8 are relatively large environmental clades. OLIGO4 has no strict relationship with any subclass. OLIGO5-8 are loosely associated with “basal” scuticociliates. OLIGO6-8 would constitute a single, large environmental clade if not for the inclusion of a single  sequence of Cyclidium porcatum.

OLIGOTRICHIA
Curator: Luciana Santoferrara


Subclass Oligotrichia
Our tree shows poor resolution, even if it was built according to the latest EukRef-Ciliophora instructions and there are no obvious errors in the corresponding alignments (both before and after trimming). Some of the explanations for low resolution are: 1- some taxa are known to show low resolution in SSU rRNA gene (SSU DNA) phylogenetic inferences (e.g. Agatha and Strüder-Kypke 2014, Santoferrara et al. 2017); 2- there may be gaps in the taxa represented in the tree (e.g. some families do not have named representatives in the trees, and may be unrepresented or only represented by relatively short sequences); these gaps may leave some relationships unresolved; and 3- these subclasses are among the most abundant organisms in one of the most common targets of environmental sequencing (marine plankton); thus, a high amount of sequences are available, and many of them are relatively short (<1000 bp). 
Despite the low resolution of the tree, annotations are as complete as possible, following the EukRef-Ciliophora instructions. Annotation of nodes poorly supported in the final tree is based on additional knowledge (mostly published bibliography, and in some cases observations from other analyses such as manual examination of alignments, BLAST and additional phylogenetic analyses). 
The monophyly of Oligotrichia and its only order (Strombidiida) have low support in our tree (20% BS), but they are accepted taxa (Lynn 2008), and thus annotated. Basal to this node, there is a single environmental sequence (AB275030; only sequence in this cluster; 1682 bp long, of apparent good quality, with at least 95% blast match to oligotrichs and assigned to Oligotrichia in SILVA) that would confer Oligotrichia a 64% support. However, its affiliation is uncertain and thus annotated as Spirotrichea. 
Strombidiida includes four families. Annotations were as follows:
The clade annotated as the family Tontoniidae has low support (6% BS) and it is unclearly crowned by environmental sequences in our tree. However, all sequenced species in this family (and only in this family) are included in this single clade. Thus, this well-known and important family (Lynn 2008; Agatha and Strüder-Kypke 2014; Santoferrara et al 2017) is annotated. The well-known genus Laboea is included in this family, although it is represented by environmental sequences (e.g. KJ759160) that are longer than the morphologically-identified sequences. Laboea and Spirotontonia are annotated; assignation of other genera is ambiguous, and thus avoided.
The family Strombidiidae is not monophyletic. Because this issue cannot be solved at present (some taxa lack representatives in the tree and/or detail cytological study), it is still an accepted taxon. However, following the EukRef-Ciliophora rules, this family is not annotated here. This is not a proposed taxonomic act, but just a consequence of EukRef-Ciliophora annotation rules. Within this “family”, the “eyespot clade” clade has low support (6% BS), but corresponds to a relatively stable clade reported before (Liu et al. 2015, Santoferrara et al 2017), thus annotated. Genus assignation within this clade is ambiguous, and thus avoided.
The remaining sequences are annotated up to the single order of the subclass (Strombidiida). As mentioned, the family Strombidiidae and several of its genera are known as non-monophyletic (Agatha and Strüder-Kypke 2014; Santoferrara et al 2017). Also, in some cases genera cannot be resolved due to the clustering at 97% similarity (mixed clusters). The family Cyrtostrombidiidae is not represented in the tree because its only two known sequences are 97.6% similar to Strombidiidae (Novistrombidium FJ422989). The family Pelagostrombidiidae has not been sequenced reliably by the time of sequence retrieval, and thus cannot be localized in the tree. Additionally, our tree includes mostly environmental sequences of unknown affiliation.
Also labeled as Strombidiida, the clades in the lower part of the tree look bizarre, but they even include some morphologically identified species (e.g. JX178821), and they look somewhat similar to neighboring, real clades (Tontonnidae is known as a “long-branching” clade; Santoferrara et al 2017). Many of these sequences were checked manually and no evident problems where found. Some are just relatively short sequences (e.g. GU819499, 1200 bp, not in SILVA, but represents 132 sequences). Four environmental clades are annotated (SPIOL1 to 4) following EukRef-Ciliophora rules.

PLAGIOPYLEA
Curator: Vittorio Boscaro



The monophyly of the order Plagiopylida, including members of Plagiopylidae, Sonderiidae and Trimyemidae, is strongly supported.
The monophyly of Trimyemidae (=Trimyema) is also strongly supported.
Representatives of Sonderiidae and Plagyopilidae cluster together with strong support. Family Sonderiidae is not monophyletic in the tree, but its two genera (Sonderia and Parasonderia) are annotated. Plagiopylidae is monophyletic and annotated, but Lechriopyla and Plagiopyla cannot be disentangled, so its genera are not.


It is very likely that the other strongly supported clade in the tree corresponds to the order Odontostomatida. However, only one sequence belongs to an identified isolate (Epalxella antiquorum), so it is impossible to define the order boundaries. The cluster including Epalxella is annotated down to the genus level (Odontostomatida, Epalxellidae, Epalxella). All other lineages are not annotated.



ENVIRONMENTAL CLADES:

Four representative sequences (not assigned to any order) satisfied the criteria for the establishment of an environmental clade, PLAGIO1.

PROSTOMATEA
Curators: Qianqian Zhang, Eleni Gentekaki



Class Prostomatea is non-monophyletic; three clades are recognized.
Order Prorodontida is non-monophyletic; three clades are recognized.

Class Prostomatea[1]
Order Prorodontida[1]
Family Colepidae (Lynn 2008) is monophyletic and well supported.
Genus Coleps is non-monophyletic; one well supported clade is found and named as Coleps[1].
Genera Apocoleps and Nolandia merged in one cluster, thus they will not show in the classification.
Genus Tiarina is monophyletic, but is only represented by one cluster (5 sequences).
Genus Pinacocoleps is monophyletic, but is only represented by one sequence.

Class Prostomatea[2]
Order Prorodontida[2]
Family Placidae (Lynn 2008) is monophyletic and supported.
Genera Placus and Spathidiopsis merged in one cluster, thus they will not show in the classification.

Class Prostomatea[3]
Order Prorodontida[3]
Family Holophryidae (Lynn 2008) is monophyletic with a single clade including only its members and is supported.
Genus Holophrya (syn. Prorodon) is monophyletic, but represented by only one cluster.
Genus Pelagothrix is monophyletic, but represented by only one cluster (2 sequences).

Unassigned genera in Conthreep:
Family Plagiocampidae (Lynn 2008; Zhang et al. 2014) is monophyletic, but represented by a single cluster (2 sequences).
Genus Plagiocampa is monophyletic, but represented by only one cluster (2 sequences).
Family Cryptocaryonidae (Wright and Colorni, 2002) is monophyletic, but represented by a single sequence.
Genus Cryptocaryon is monophyletic, but represented by only one cluster (2 sequences).

Genus Paraspathidium is monophyletic, but represented by only one cluster (2 sequences).

Genus Askenasia is monophyletic.
Genus Urotricha is monophyletic, but represented by only one cluster.

Environmental clade CONTH[1-6] are well supported. These sequences are closely related to prostomate species and could be assigned to the ConthreeP super-clade. 
Clade “Cyclotrichium like organisms” is well supported. This clade is composed by environmental sequences and one known genus Cyclotrichium, for which the phylogenetic position in Ciliophora is uncertain (Zhang et al. 2012; Gao et al. 2016).
